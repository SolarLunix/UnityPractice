## [Clock Project](https://github.com/SolarLunix/UnityPractice/tree/master/Clock)
In the clock project, I follow the tutorial on [Creating A Clock](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/game-objects-and-scripts/) to first create the standard clock, with a little bit of my own choices of colours. Working off of this code, I then created a digital clock and made it look to be lit by LED. The user can switch between the two clocks using a button in the bottom right corner. 

## [Graph Project](https://github.com/SolarLunix/UnityPractice/tree/master/Graph)
In the graph project, I follow the tutorial on [Building A Graph](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/building-a-graph/) and added a little bit of my own flare in the way that the colours changed.
